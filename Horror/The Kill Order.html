            <p>
                Mark and Trina form an alliance with Alec, Lana, and others who rescue them from a group of street urchins. The group flees to the fictional Lincoln building to avoid an impending<br>
                tsunami. They camp out in the building for weeks until a yacht arrives and the ship's crew takes them hostage and kills one of them. Alec manages to overcome their captors and they<br>
                take the yacht as their own, and they pilot the boat to the Appalachian Beaches.<br>

                The story resumes one year after the tsunami near Asheville – a small North Carolina village where Mark, Trina, Alec, and Lana now live. Huge helicopter-like vehicles called Bergs <br>
                arrive and attack the people in the village; the Berg crew showers their settlement with darts that kill many villagers. Alec and Mark manage to subdue and take over a Berg but its<br>
                pilot crashes the vehicle to avoid answering questions. They discover that the darts contained a deadly virus, and start their long journey back to their village.<br>

                Three days later they reach the village to find that the virus had killed most of the infected. Lana and Trina explain that after the initial death toll, people started living a little<br>
                longer before dying; symptoms of infection also changed. Mark and Alec explain that the darts were filled with a virus and the group suspects that the virus is mutating.<br>

                Trina and Lana take Mark and Alec to a locked room where one of their other friends, Darnell, is confined. He had started having hallucinations, apparently due to the virus, and begged<br>
                Trina and Lana to lock him up and they did so. Their sickening friend started saying that "They" were in his brain, eating it away. He kept repeating that "They" were going to eat at<br>
                his head until nothing was left. He suddenly starts banging his head against a wall to silence "Them" and ends up killing himself.<br>

                Another girl, Misty, who was his friend goes into the room and comes out reporting a headache that alarms Mark and Alec. They tell Lana and Trina to lock her up as well. Immediately <br>
                after they confine, she starts acting just like her dead friend, talking about "Them", and starts to sing an eerie song about death.<br>

                Mark and Alec take Lana and Trina to find the mysterious attackers' base. The group passes through an abandoned village where they meet a 5-year-old girl named Deedee, whom they take with<br>
                them. She tells them that just like their own settlement, her village was attacked months earlier. The people turned crazy and left her behind. She shows the group a puncture mark that<br>
                alarms Alec, who tells the group that Deedee must be infected. They decide to take her with them, anyway, since if she didn't have symptoms over months after being infected by the virus<br>
                she was obviously immune to it.<br>

                While traveling to find the attackers' base, Mark and Alec leave the group for a while to investigate a loud noise. They encounter a cult of infected people, who believe that since Deedee<br>
                is not affected by the virus like they are, she must be some sort of demon. Mark and Alec manage to escape from the cult but find that a forest fire has been started and that Trina, Lana<br>
                and Deedee are gone from their campsite. Believing that the three girls in their party must have escaped and gone ahead of them to the attackers base, Mark and Alec continue on to the<br>
                site.<br>

                They arrive at the base and sneak into what appears to be the Post-Flares Coalition's (PFC) site. They eavesdrop on a conversation and realize that the disease is widely known as "the<br>
                Flare", caused by a virus that shuts down the thinking-part of people's brains. They also learn that the girls were given back to the infected cult. They are caught eavesdropping but <br>
                manage to escape and steal a Berg. Mark and Alec find weapons inside the Berg called transvices – guns that evaporate people's molecules. They recharge one to use to battle the infected<br>
                . Mark realizes that the Flare has started to affect his mind.<br>

                        For someone as young as Mark, you'd think that every twist and turn in his adventure would be some kind of grand occurrence. Being surprised at new things is just an (awesome) accessory
                        of being young. Unfortunately, Mark's been through so many horrific events that nothing seems to be intriguing to him anymore. Well, unless we're talking about Trina. She's the only one
                        who can still make him surprised (and blush).
                        Nevertheless, Mark can still be pretty naïve. Throughout the book, he makes rash decisions (like speaking when he shouldn't, or attacking bad guys impulsively), and he ultimately proves
                        to be a teensy bit childish

                        Unfortunately for the rest of the characters, Mark and Alec take up most of the spotlight in The Kill Order. This is mostly because Trina, Lana, and Deedee have a bad habit of being held
                        hostage somewhere.
                        But from what we get from Trina, we can tell she's a tough cookie. In fact, she seems much tougher than her guy-pal, Mark. Unlike Mark, she likes to rush toward the actionâ€”which eventually
                        transforms him into a tough(er) cookie too. Phrases like, "We need to get up there, see what's going onâ€”see if we can help" often come from Trina

                        Oh, Lana. We still have no idea what might have happened to her. See, unlike most of the other people who die in the book, Lana gets shot by a Transvice. So really, she could still be
                        floating around in space. Who knows?
                        For what we get of Lana though, we learn that she's the brains of the operation. She knows what she's talking about and what she's doing. And, if she weren't stabbed so quickly, we know
                        she would've played a huge role in Deedee's survival. joke always at the ready

                        Chigurh is a hitman who is devoid of conscience, remorse and compassion. He is described by Carson Wells, a central character in the novel, as a "psychopathic killer", in his 30s, with
                        a dark complexion, and eyes as "blue as lapis ... Like wet stones." His signature weapon is a captive bolt stunner, which he uses to kill his victims and also as a tool to shoot out
                        door locks. He also wields a sound-suppressed Remington 11-87 semiautomatic shotgun and pistol (as well as a TEC-9 in the film adaptation). Throughout both the novel and the film,
                        Chigurh flips a coin to decide the fate of some of his victims.

                <p>The story resumes one year after the tsunami near Asheville â€“ a small North Carolina village where Mark, Trina, Alec, and Lana now live. Huge helicopter-like vehicles called Bergs arr
                    and attack the people in the village; the Berg crew showers their settlement with darts that kill many villagers. Alec and Mark manage to subdue and take over a Berg but its pilot cras
                    the vehicle to avoid answering questions. They discover that the darts contained a deadly virus, and start their long journey back to their village.
                    Three days later they reach the village to find that the virus had killed most of the infected. Lana and Trina explain that after the initial death toll, people started living a little
                    longer before dying; symptoms of infection also changed. Mark and Alec explain that the darts were filled with a virus and the group suspects that the virus is mutating.
                    Trina and Lana take Mark and Alec to a locked room where one of their other friends, Darnell, is confined.
