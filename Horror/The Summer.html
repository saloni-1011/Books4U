            <p>
                Horror is a tricky genre. Too often, authors working in this mode resort to shocks and unexpected twists for their scares. <br>
                Truly effective horror, by contrast, is unsettling. It has a human element that relies not on shopworn tactics or supernatural<br>
                frights, but rather a slow tiptoeing toward the inevitable. Done right, horror is less a mood and more a character in and of <br>
                itself, one that grows and takes shape as the bodies pile up.<br>
                In The Summer Is Ended and We Are Not Yet Saved, Joey Comeau steeps the horrific elements in a brew of emotional vulnerability <br>
                and abuse of trust. The novel follows 11-year-old Martin and his mother, Elizabeth, who was only 18 when he was born. By day, Elizabeth<br>
                works at the cosmetics counter in a Halifax department store, but her true passion is doing makeup for horror movies.

                        Martin and his young, excitable, but loving single mother have a rough existence: Martin's a little odd, obsessed with cleanliness, <br>
                        and has trouble making friends, while Mom works multiple steady but boring jobs to support them, leaving her with little time to spend<br>

                        when she drinks she becomes reckless and bemoans having had a child at such a young age. Martin – sweet, innocent, and just a little bit<br>
                        naive – is her rock. He doesn’t need to know the details behind her strained relationship with her parents, or why she chose atheism over<br>
                        Christianity; he just needs to be there when she needs him most. </td>

                        Comeau uses brevity and detail to his advantage: the novel moves from one scene to another at a relentless pace. Locations and characters<br>
                        are sketched simply, while each killing is described with perverse attention to detail, from the sight of bright red blood juxtaposed with a<br>
                        counsellor’s blonde hair to the spray patterns of a ruptured carotid artery. The effect is powerful. When violence erupts, it stains the page.<br>
                        Comeau’s subtext-rich tale of a mother and son bond stretched to its limit walks a fine line between family values and all-out carnage, and <br>
                        does so with a spring in its step.

                    Comeau's work is difficult to classify by genre. Of his eight books, two are comic collections, one is a "genderqueer adventure story",<br>
                    one is an experimental novel told through job application letters, two are collections of short stories, and two are horror. In 2003, <br>
                    Comeau co-created the webcomic A Softer World with Emily Horne. His first novel, Lockpick Pornography, was serialized on the A Softer World <br>
                    site prior to publication in book form by Loose Teeth Press. Excerpts from his novel Overqualified were included in the 2010 Best American <br>
                    Nonrequired Reading. The first 20 chapters of his novel One Bloody Thing After Another were serialized on the National Post's book blog[1] <br>
                    and the book was nominated for the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award.[2] One Bloody Thing After Another was also nominated for the 2011 ReLit Awards.[3]
