        <p>Hill House is a mansion in a location that is never specified but is between many hills. The story concerns four main characters Dr. John Montague
            an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents having lived as a recluse caring for her demanding disabled mother
            [4] Theodora, a flamboyant, bohemian artist; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House, who is host to the others.All four of the inhabitants
            begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange riting on the walls, and
            other unexplained events. Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious
            Dr. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as hisguests several
            people whom he has chosen because of their experiences with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept Eleanor travels to the house
            where she and Theodora will live in isolation with Montague and Luke
            Hill House has two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, who refuse to stay near the house at night. The blunt and single-minded Mrs. Dudley isa source of some
            comic relief. The four overnight visitors begin to form friendships as Dr. Montague explains the building's history, which encompasses suicide and other
            violent deaths. </p>

            <p>The novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1963 and again in 1999, both times under the title The Haunting. The 1963 version is a relatively faithful adaptation and of<br>
                received critical praise. The 1999 version, considerably different from the novel and widely panned by critics, is an overt fantasy horror in which all the main characters<br>
                are terrorized and two are killed by explicitly supernatural deaths. It was also parodied in Scary Movie 2 (2001).<br>
                It was first adapted for the stage in 1964 by F. Andrew Leslie.[15] In 2015, Anthony Neilson prepared a new stage adaptation for Sonia Friedman and Hammer for production <br>
                at the Liverpool Playhouse.</p>
