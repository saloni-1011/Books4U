        <p>House of Leaves begins with a first-person narrative by Johnny Truant, a Los Angeles tattoo parlor employee and professed unreliable narrator.<br>
            Truant is searching for a new apartment when his friend Lude tells him about the apartment of the recently deceased Zampanò, a blind, elderly man<br>
            who lived in Lude's apartment building.<br>

            In Zampanò's apartment, Truant discovers a manuscript written by Zampanò that turns out to be an academic study of a documentary film called <br>
            The Navidson Record, though Truant says he can find no evidence that the film or its subjects ever existed<br>

            The rest of the novel incorporates several narratives, including Zampanò's report on the (possibly fictional) film; Truant's autobiographical <br>
            interjections; a small transcript of part of the film from Navidson's brother, Tom; a small transcript of interviews of many people regarding <br>
            The Navidson Record by Navidson's partner, Karen; and occasional brief notes by unidentified editors, all woven together by a mass of footnotes.<br>
            There is also another narrator, Truant's mother, whose voice is presented through a self-contained set of letters titled The Whalestoe Letters. <br>
            Each narrator's text is printed in a distinct font, making it easier for the reader to follow the occasionally challenging format of the novel <br>
            (Truant in Courier New in the footnotes, and the main narrative in Times New Roman in the American version, the unnamed editors are in Bookman,<br>
            and the letters from Johnny's mother are in Dante)...</p>

                    unclear if Johnny's obsession with the writings of Zampanò and subsequent delusions, paranoia, etc. are the result of drug use, insanity, or the <br>
                    effects of Zampanò's writing itself. Johnny recounts tales of his various sexual encounters, his lust for a tattooed dancer he calls Thumper,<br>
                    and his bar-hopping with Lude throughout various footnotes. The reader also slowly learns more about Johnny's childhood living with an abusive<br>
                    foster father, engaging in violent fights at school, and of the origin of Johnny's mysterious scars (House of Leaves, p. 505). More information <br>
                    about Johnny can be gleaned from the Whalestoe Letters, letters his mother Pelafina wrote from The Three Attic Whalestoe Institution. .

                    Zampanò is the blind author of The Navidson Record. Approximately eighty years old at the time of his death, he is recognized by his neighbors <br>
                    as "eccentric" and "crazy." He was known to employ the services of volunteers (exclusively female) from local community centers to come to his<br>
                    apartment and read books to him. While little information is given explicitly about Zampanò's past, blindness, or personality, Johnny's introduction<br>
                    does state that Zampanò went blind sometime in the 1950s. Zampanò also suffers from Graphomania.<br>
                    Danielewski made Zampanò blind as a reference to blind authors Homer, John Milton and Jorge Luis Borges.[6] </td>

            <p>THouse of Leaves is the debut novel by American author Mark Z. Danielewski, published in March 2000 by Pantheon Books. A bestseller, it has been<br>
                translated into a number of languages, and is followed by a companion piece, The Whalestoe Letters.<br>
                The plot is centered on a (possibly fictional) documentary about a family whose house is impossibly larger on the inside than the outside. The format<br>
                and structure of House of Leaves is unconventional, with unusual page layout and style, making it a prime example of ergodic literature.[1][2] It<br>
                contains copious footnotes, many of which contain footnotes themselves, including references to fictional books, films or articles.[3] In contrast<br>
                , some pages contain only a few words or lines of text, arranged in strange ways to mirror the events in the story, often creating both an agoraphobic <br>
                and a claustrophobic effect.
